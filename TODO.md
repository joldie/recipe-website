# To Do

## High priority
- [ ] UX: (addrecipe.php, editrecipe.php) ability to delete arbitrary ingredient/step, not just the last one

## Medium priority
- [ ] Code cleanup: Add comments to code, in particular functions in separate files
- [ ] UX: (index.php) add more recipes to page dynamically as user scrolls down (test with showing 6 first, instead of 12). Should improve loading speed, also.
- [ ] Refactor: move recipeindb, deleterecipe to resources/library
- [ ] Refactor: make insertrecipe.php, updaterecipe.php functions in library
- [ ] UX: (addrecipe.php) ingredient unit dropdown box
- [ ] UX: (addrecipe.php, editrecipe.php) ability to move up and down (maybe drag with mouse/finger) position of ingredients or steps in list
- [ ] Add functionality to print A4 sheet(s) for recipes
- [ ] UX: Move delete button from main recipe page to edit recipe page to reduce chance of accidental deletions
- [ ] Change spinner to simpler CSS design (e.g. #3: https://codepen.io/Paolo-Duzioni/pen/ZoRabJ?editors=0100 )

## Low priority
- [ ] UX: Button to rotate uploaded photos 90Â°
- [ ] UX: (index.php) enable quotes "" and wildcards * in search, search for parts of words, search by tag:dinner, ingredient:carrot, etc
- [ ] UX: show suggestions for tags, based on a) master list; and/or b) previously used tag names
- [ ] CSS: highlight/underline menu links on hover
- [ ] UX: loading screen turns to tick for successful query, etc (instead of alert box)
- [ ] Improve Lighthouse audit report score (add HTTP/2, improve accessbility, PWA, etc)
- [ ] Include ability for viewers/users to add comments below recipes
- [ ] Implement a basic user login system (username & password only) for creating/editing recipes, commenting, etc.
- [ ] Include lightweight sharing buttons for Facebook, Twitter, etc
- [ ] Setup Google Analytics, or similar

## Future features
- Publish site in German, also. Add ability in code to switch language between EN/DE
