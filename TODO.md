# To Do

## High priority
- [ ] UX: (addrecipe.php, editrecipe.php) ability to delete arbitrary ingredient/step, not just the last one

## Medium priority
- [ ] Code cleanup: Add comments to code, in particular functions in separate files
- [ ] UX: (index.php) add more recipes to page dynamically as user scrolls down (test with showing 6 first, instead of 12). Should improve loading speed, also.
- [ ] Refactor: move recipeindb, deleterecipe to resources/library
- [ ] Refactor: make insertrecipe.php, updaterecipe.php functions in library
- [ ] UX: (addrecipe.php) ingredient unit dropdown box
- [ ] UX: (addrecipe.php, editrecipe.php) ability to move up and down (maybe drag with mouse/finger) position of ingredients or steps in list

## Low priority
- [ ] UX: Button to rotate uploaded photos 90Â°
- [ ] UX: (index.php) enable quotes "" and wildcards * in search, search for parts of words, search by tag:dinner, ingredient:carrot, etc
- [ ] UX: show suggestions for tags, based on a) master list; and/or b) previously used tag names
- [ ] CSS: highlight/underline menu links on hover
- [ ] UX: loading screen turns to tick for successful query, etc (instead of alert box)
- [ ] Improve Lighthouse audit report score (add HTTP/2, improve accessbility, PWA, etc)

## Future features
- Publish site in German, also. Add ability in code to switch language between EN/DE
