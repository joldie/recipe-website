		<h1>About Us</h1>
			We're a couple of long-time vegetarians, recently turned vegan.
			<br />
			We're experimenting in our kitchen with new meal ideas and
			re-inventing old classics.
			<br />
			It's a learning process and we'd like to share it with you all.
			<br />
			<br />
			Feel free to copy, improve and share all the recipes on this site.
