		<p>
			Switching from a "normal" diet to a plant-based one can be a little daunting at first. After all, many of us grew up eating meals heavy in meat and dairy and so that's simply what we know how to cook. But eating vegan is easy - it just takes a small change in mindset!
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>recipes:rebooted</strong> was born with the idea of making it easier for well-intentioned, but busy, people to quickly choose a meal and prepare it without fuss at the end of a long day. No more should you have to settle for spaghetti bolognese twice in a week, simply because you can whip it up in 15 minutes without thinking.
